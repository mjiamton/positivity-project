            We are a group of ladies who met on the Code First Girls Introduction to Web Development course, practicing HTML, CSS & Javascript through making this platform. COVID-19 meant everything was online and we managed to make this website without meeting each other in person!

                <h3> Helen </h3>
                <p>
                    Helen is currently working as a Team Leader at a materials testing company called Intertek, based in
                    Derby. She grew up in US, Taiwan and UK, having moved to London at the age of 10. She graduated from
                    Imperial College London with a degree in Materials Science and Engineering, and is studying a part-time
                    Master's at University of Surrey. 
                </p>

                <p>    
                    Juggling between work and going back into education proved to be a bit
                    of a challenge. Outside of work, she is a keen traveller and loves meeting people from different
                    background and is always on the lookout for new experiences.
                </p>

                <p>
                    She enrolled on the CFG Intro to Web Development to develop her coding skills further, after an
                    unsuccessful attempt at university.

                    media, design thinking and research, conceptual development and now web development. Having a
                    multi-disciplinary background, she is an adaptable team player with transferable skills. She is currently open for opportunities.

                <h3>Zafirah</h3>
                <p>
                    Zafirah is currently studying International Business and Management, at Aston University in Birmingham.
                    Growing up, she's been accustomed to a diverse range of backgrounds, mainly Portuguese and Indian.
                    Having moved out to University from her hometown of Leicester, she's always keen to try something new
                    and meet lots of interesting people along the way!
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Outside of studies, she loves climbing mountains, anything outdoors and social enterprise related. She
                    is due to start her Placement Year Abroad working for Deloitte Switzerland later this year.
                    She enrolled on the CFG Intro to Web Development to further develop her coding skills, as she's always
                    wanted to build something from scratch!
